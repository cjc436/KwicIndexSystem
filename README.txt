Kwic Index System
by: Cristos Criniti (cjc436)

Instructions:
To run this program, run the "main" method in KwicIndexSystemDriver.
The program will prompt you with a file path for your input file in the command line.
It will also prompt you with a file path for your file containing your stop words.
At the end of the process, it will prompt you with a file name to write the output to. The output will go to the "output" directory in the project.

Provided testing files:
I provided you with a test file, "test.txt", as an input file for testing, but you can provide the file path for your own.
I also provided you with a test file, "testStopWords.txt", containing some stop words in the correct format.

Output:
All output files will go to the "output" directory in the project. Each file will have the file name that you provide on the command line when prompted.
There is also already a file in the "output" directory called "test_indexed.txt" that I left as an example.

Known Faults:
None

More Information about Stop Word Functionality:
For the stop words functionality to work the way that you would want, the file that you provided must contain the stop words in the correct format.

The correct format for your stop words file should have one stop word on each individual line of the file.
For an example, see below or look at the example file, "testStopWords.txt", in the project:
